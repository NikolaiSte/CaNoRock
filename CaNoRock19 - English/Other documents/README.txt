placement_and_orientation.jpg
	Marked the placement of each sensor module and its sensing coordinatesystem. Also marked
	the pinout. IMPORTANT! The x-axis of the LSM9DS1 is opposite that of the other sensors.


Manual_for_scientific_instruments_on_the_NAROM student_rocket_campaign.docx
	This is a document that will be handed out up at andøya. This is the overview and introduction
	for each sensormodule that will be on the rocket at launch. The important part of this document
	is page 14 where the frames and subframes are explained. The structuring of these frames and subframes
	are fairly similar to that presented in this document. 1 frame contains 5 subframes which inturn contains
	20 bytes. Subframe 0 cotains info from GPS, subframe 1,2, and 3 contains info about the LSM, BMI and ICM
	respectively. Subframe 5 is unused. If this structuring of the frame is unclear please dont hesitate to ask.
	This was the part that presented the most challenges last year and is important for both validating the design
	before launch, and useful to know for the analysis part after the launch.

Specification for modules on NAROM student rockets.docx
	Document for the general specification-constraints for each module flying on the rocket.
	This is probably not information you will need, but I've added it here anyways.

CAD-files
	These are the workfiles for the PCB-design. These are probably not needed, but I've added them anyways.
